    <tr>
        <td> Rocks in science refer to naturally occurring solid aggregates composed of minerals or mineral-like substances. Rocks can vary greatly in composition, texture, and appearance. They are fundamental components of the Earth's crust and play a crucial role in various geological processes. Scientists study rocks to understand the history of the Earth, its structure, and the processes that shape its surface. Rocks can provide valuable information about past environments, climate changes, and geological events. They are also important resources for industries such as construction, mining, and agriculture. </td>

                <p class="p2td5">These rocks are formed from the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. Depending on where the cooling occurs (either beneath the Earth's surface or on the surface), igneous rocks are classified into intrusive (plutonic) and extrusive (volcanic) rocks. Examples include obsidian (as shown on the picture), basalt, and granite. </p>

                <p class="p2td6">
                    These rocks are formed from the accumulation and compression of sediments (particles of minerals, rocks, or organic materials) over time. Sedimentary rocks often form in layers through processes like weathering, erosion, transportation, deposition, and lithification. Examples include limestone, which is visible on the accompanying image, sandstone,and shale. </p>

                <p class="p1td7"> Metamorphic Rocks </p>
                <p class="p2td7">
                    These rocks are formed from pre-existing rocks (igneous, sedimentary, or other metamorphic rocks) that undergo physical or chemical changes due to high temperature, pressure, or chemically active fluids. Metamorphic rocks typically have a crystalline structure and may exhibit foliation (layering). Examples include marble, as seen in the image above, slate, and gneiss.
