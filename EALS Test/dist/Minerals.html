                <p class="p1td5"> Quartz </p>
                <p class="p2td5">Widely distributed mineral of many varieties that consists primarily of silica, or silicon dioxide (SiO2). Minor impurities such as lithium, sodium, potassium, and titanium may be present. Quartz has attracted attention from the earliest times; water-clear crystals were known to the ancient Greeks as krystallos—hence the name crystal, or more commonly rock crystal, applied to this variety. The name quartz is an old German word of uncertain origin first used by Georgius Agricola in 1530. </p>

                <p class="p2td6">
                    Gold, derived from the Old English word "geolu," meaning yellow, owes its name to its distinctive hue. This globally abundant mineral, primarily comprised of pure gold (Au) and often alloyed with trace elements like silver and copper, boasts a rich history intertwined with human civilization. Revered for millennia, gold has adorned royalty, fueled economies, and symbolized wealth and prestige across cultures. From ancient Egypt's pharaohs to modern-day investors, gold's enduring allure remains undiminished, serving as a timeless store of value and a tangible symbol of prosperity. </p>

                    Renowned for their mesmerizing brilliance and enduring allure, are among the world's most coveted gemstones. Composed of pure carbon, diamonds form under immense pressure and heat deep within the Earth's mantle. Their name is derived from the Greek word "adámas," meaning unbreakable or invincible, reflecting their exceptional hardness and durability. Throughout history, diamonds have symbolized love, strength, and eternal commitment, adorning the crowns of monarchs and the fingers of betrothed lovers. From ancient civilizations to modern luxury, diamonds continue to captivate hearts and inspire awe as enduring symbols of beauty and prestige.

                    Prized for their vibrant green hues and captivating allure, have enchanted civilizations for centuries. Formed from beryllium, aluminum, and trace elements like chromium and vanadium, emeralds derive their name from the Greek word "smaragdos," meaning green gem. Revered by ancient cultures like the Egyptians and Incas, emeralds symbolize renewal, growth, and vitality. From royal adornments to modern haute couture, emeralds have adorned the crowns of kings and the necks of celebrities, embodying opulence and elegance. With their timeless beauty and mystical charm, emeralds continue to reign as cherished treasures, evoking a sense of enchantment and sophistication.
